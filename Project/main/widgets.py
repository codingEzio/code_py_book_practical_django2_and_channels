    What is 'widget' anyway?
        A widget is Djangoâ€™s representation of an HTML input element.
        Thus, it's PART of the "form fields" (like `IntegerField`). Yep, it's smaller.

    A better widget to manage changes to <product quantities>.
        The one we'll modify is also an "input" widget, that's why we import the `Widget`.
