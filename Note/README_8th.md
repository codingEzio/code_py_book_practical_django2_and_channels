### Review
- Okay, okay.. Now we've solved some *nasty* bugs.
- There's still one <small>( & **only one** )</small> is yet to be solved, which is
    - The *image switching* feature, yep, it has no effect if u clicked on them
    - Ah, the most weird one is that **the tests passed** <small>( with some *path* issues, though )</small>
- So?
    - I'll skip that for now <small>( since the *py* | *js* tests could pass :P )</small>
    - And it's really not a big deal since it doesn't affect the **core features**.
